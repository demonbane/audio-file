=head1 NAME

Audio::File - Audio file abstraction library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Audio::File;
  my $file = Audio::File->new( "foo.bar" );

  print "The ". $file->type() ."-file ". $file->name
  		." is ". int $file->length() ." seconds long.\n";

  print "It's interpreted by ". $file->tag->artist()
  		." and called ". $file->tag->title() ".\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Audio::File abstracts a single audio file, independant of its format. Using this
module you can access a files meta-info like title, album, etc. as well as the
files audio-properties like its length and bitrate.

Currently only the formats flac, ogg vorbis and mp3 are supported, but support
for other formats may be easily added.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  $file = Audio::File->new( "foobar.flac" );

Constructor. It takes the filename of the your audio file as its only argument
and returns an instance of Audio::File::${Type} if the corresponding file type
is supported. The file type will be determined using the file extension.
Currently flac, ogg and mp3 are supported but new formats may be added easily by
creating a Audio::File::${Type} that inherits from Audio::File::Type, which is
the base class for all file type classes.

The methods and behaviour of the returned are documented in
L<Audio::File::Type>.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item * Add possibility to change file and its tags.

=item * better (easier) interface?

=item * user shouldn't be forced to use Audio::File if he only want's the files
tag or audio properties.

=item * Add possibility to access raw audio data (Audio::File::Data)

That could be done via Audio::Data or equivalent.
