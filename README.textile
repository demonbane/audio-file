h2. Description

Audio::File abstracts a single audio file, independant of its format. Using this module you can access a file's meta-info like title, album, etc. as well as the file's audio properties like its length and bitrate.

Currently supported formats are: FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, MP3, and MP4, but support for other formats may be easily added.

h3. History

This is a fork of Florian Ragwitz's original Audio::File module. The upstream author has apparently abandoned both the module and the Debian package for which he is the maintainer, so I have taken over maintaing this unofficial fork.
