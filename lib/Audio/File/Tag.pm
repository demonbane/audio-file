=head1 NAME

Audio::File::Tag - abstracts the tag of an audio file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Audio::File::Tag is the base class for other file format independant tag classes
like Audio::File::Flac::Tag or Audio::File::Ogg::Tag. You shouldn't use this
class yourself exept you're writing an own file format dependant subclass.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Constructor. Creates a new Audio::File::Tag object. You shouldn't use this
method yourself. It is called by the filetype-dependant subclasses of
Audio::File::Type automatically.

=cut

sub new {
	my($class, $filename) = @_;
	$class = ref $class || $class;
	my $self = { filename => $filename };
	bless $self, $class;
	$self->init(@_) or return;
	return $self;
}

=head2 init

Initializes the object. It's called by the constructor and empty by default.
It's ought to be overwritten by subclasses.

=cut

sub init {

}

=head2 title

Using title() you can get or set the tags title field. If called without any
argument it'll return the current content of the title field. If you call
title() with an scalar argument it will set the title field to what the argument
contains. The methods artist(), album(), comment(), genre(), year(), track(), disc()
and total() are called in the same way.
